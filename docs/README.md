## Game mechanics:

### Overworld

If a trainer catches you within their line of sight, you will be forced to battle!
There is no preparation, so be ready beforehand.

Each map has an exit point.
Entering these exit points will take you to a new map, with new entities that come with
it.

### Battle

In battle, you have four core options: **Fight**, **Bag**, **Run**, and **Pokémon**.

**Fight:** The main function of battling.
Choose a move, and fight until you've fainted all of your opponent's Pokémon, or vice versa.

**Bag:** Here you can use items that can restore your Pokémon,
increase their battle stats, or if it's a wild Pokémon battle,
enable you to catch the Pokémon.

**Run:** Attempt to run away from a wild Pokémon.

**Pokémon:** Check your Pokémon's stats or swap out which Pokémon is currently battling.
